# Skill Author

## Prerequisites

Skill authoring must not be blocked after the temporary bootstrap file is removed.

1. **If `AGENTS_skills.md` exists** at the repository root — bootstrap is **not** finished. Do not follow these steps until **`AGENTS_skills.md`** Path A or Path B is completed and that file is removed (see **`AGENTS_skills.md`**).

2. **If `AGENTS_skills.md` does not exist** — the repo has finished bootstrap. Proceed **unless** the project’s own docs forbid it: check root **`AGENTS.md`**, **README**, or **CONTRIBUTING** for a Path B “skills / authoring” policy or any project-specific gate. Path B repos usually record policy in **`AGENTS.md`** so agents still see the rules without relying on a deleted bootstrap file.

Do **not** treat “`AGENTS_skills.md` missing” as an error — it is expected after setup. Rely on **`AGENTS_skills.md`** only while it is present.

Load `skill-template` first if you need the canonical layout and refactor notes.

## Steps

1. Create directory: `.skills/_skills/<name>/`
2. Copy `.skills/_skills/skill-template/SKILL.md` as your starting point
3. Fill in frontmatter — `name` must match directory name exactly
4. Write the body as agent-facing instructions, not human documentation
5. Choose triggers carefully — these are what cause the skill to be loaded
6. Run `.skills/_harness/build-index.sh --write` to regenerate `.skills/_index.md` from frontmatter — the index is the source of truth at runtime and must always be in sync with `.skills/_skills/`
7. If this skill depends on another, list it in `dependencies`
8. If native discovery symlinks are configured, re-run `.skills/_harness/link.sh` with the appropriate target (e.g. `.agents/skills`) to include the new skill
9. Run `.skills/_harness/check.sh` to validate index and frontmatter consistency (if your environment supports script execution)

## Renaming or deleting a skill

When renaming or removing an existing skill, update `.skills/_index.md` in the same operation:

- **Rename:** update the directory name, the frontmatter `name` field, and the index row together.
- **Delete:** remove the directory and its index row together.

Never leave the index out of sync with the skills directory.

## Frontmatter checklist

- [ ] `name` matches directory name
- [ ] `description` is one sentence, suitable for an index
- [ ] `triggers` covers the natural language phrases that should invoke this skill
- [ ] `dependencies` is present (empty list `[]` if none)
- [ ] `version` is set

## Body structure

Use these sections as needed — not all are required:

- **When to use this skill** — conditions for loading
- **Instructions** — step-by-step agent directions
- **Examples** — concrete usage examples
- **Notes** — edge cases, caveats, or references

## What makes a good trigger

Triggers should match how a user would naturally ask for the task, not internal
jargon. Prefer phrases over single words. Think about what someone would type
before they knew this skill existed.

## Circular dependencies

Avoid cycles in `dependencies`. If you detect a cycle, load skills in alphabetical order by `name` and stop after one full pass — then tell the user to fix the dependency graph.
